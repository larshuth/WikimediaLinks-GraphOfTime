#Wikimedia Links - Graph of Time
This is for now an upload / free distribution of the code of my bachelor thesis' project - "Dynamic Graph Representation of Wikipedia's Multilingual Link Structure over Time"

We are offering a tool for representing Wikimedia projects, mainly Wikipedia, its articles and its internal references and how they are changing over time in the structure of a dynamic graph.

This project was originally started summer semester 2019 under the supervision of the Goethe University Algorithm Engineering Group (Prof Meyer).

The tool does not work as of now. A central piece, the wikisort-algorithm has been removed due to different reasons. I am on it to fix said fault by changing the format of the log-files and replacing wikisort with the UNIX untility sort.
